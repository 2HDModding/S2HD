# S2HD

* A decompilation of Sonic 2 HD.

* Runs on x64 only (sadly)

* Decomp done in one hour.

# Tools used

I used dotpeek to export the project and dnSpy to reference the scripts while fixing them, I also used [this](https://github.com/maybekoi/FSNSFix) to turn "namespace S2HD;" to "namespace S2HD {".

## How to build

Clone the project, open the Visual Studio solution file, and you should be good to go!
